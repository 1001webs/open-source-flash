# Petition to open source Flash

So Adobe, you're [killing Flash now](https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html).

Flash is an important piece of Internet history and killing Flash Player means future generations can't access the past.

We want Adobe to open source Flash!

Star this repository to sign the petition. Pull requests are also welcome. Add cool Flash links here and reasons to open source Flash.
