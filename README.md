# Petition to open source Flash

So Adobe, you're [killing Flash now](https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html).

Flash is an important piece of Internet history and killing Flash Player means future generations can't access the past. Games, experiments and websites would be forgotten.

Open sourcing Flash would be a good solution to keep Flash projects alive safely for archive reasons. Don't know how, but that's the beauty of open source: you never know what will come up after you go open source!

Notice: The idea is not to save Flash Player, but to open source Flash!

__Star this repository to sign the petition.__ Pull requests are also welcome. Add cool Flash links here and reasons to open source Flash.

This petition will be delivered to Adobe.
