# Petition to open source Flash

So Adobe, you're [killing Flash now](https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html).

Flash is an important piece of Internet history and killing Flash Player means future generations can't access the past. Games, experiments and websites would be forgotten.

Open sourcing Flash would be a good solution to keep Flash projects alive safely for archive reasons. Don't know how, but that's the beauty of open source: you never know what will come up after you go open source!

We understand that there are licenced components you can not release. Simply leave them out with a note explaining what was removed. We will either bypass them, or replace them with open soure alternatives.

Notice: The idea is not to save Flash Player, but to open source Flash!

__Star this repository to sign the petition.__ Pull requests are also welcome. Add cool Flash links here and reasons to open source Flash.

This petition will be delivered to Adobe.

## Flash as an art medium
Flash was also a platform for creative expression in an exciting new medium with global reach at a time when sound and moving images were barely breaking into the internet. Many artists took the media and shaped it to their own style. These digital pieces were both mesmerizing and disturbing. 

We do lots to save and restore old manuscripts so, why not consider any interactive artworks that were developed on this platform and can't be ported truthfully to just a video format.

Feel free to add other interactive art projects that you think deserve to be saved:
