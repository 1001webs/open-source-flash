# Petition to open source Flash

So Adobe, you're [killing Flash now](https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html).

Flash is an important piece of Internet history and killing Flash Player means future generations can't access the past. Games, experiments and websites would be forgotten.

Open sourcing Flash would be a good solution to keep Flash alive but safe for archive reasons.

Star this repository to sign the petition. Pull requests are also welcome. Add cool Flash links here and reasons to open source Flash.

This petition will be delivered to Adobe.
